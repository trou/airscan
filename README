AirScan is a basic wardriving utility for the Nintendo DS

This app was inspired by wifi_lib_test v0.3a by Stephen Stair.
Thanks a lot Stephen for dswifi !
See his page at http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/.

There is not much to know, basic usage information is displayed
when launched.

Known bugs :
	- crashes sometimes when the number of APs is high (> 400)
	- when connecting to an AP then going back to scanning 
	  and trying to connect to another AP will not work
	  correctly (dswifi bug ?)
	- timeouts handling is still probably a bit buggy

How to build :
Pach dswifi using included patch, or use version 0.3.12 which includes it,
rebuild, rebuild default.arm7, copy
now you can build airscan :
make


Please read the TODO file before mailing me.
Do NOT mail me to ask me how to crack WEP/WPA ...
Also, the DS is way too underpowered to be even close to useful
to crack WEP/WPA access point. If you want to do that, use a PC
and aircrack.
