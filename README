AirScan is a Wi-FI scanning utility for the Nintendo DS. It offers various
filtering features to facilitate access point discovery.
For example, it can be used to locate open access points in low WiFi density
areas thanks to its sensivity.

Interesting features include :
	- Display only desired protection levels (open, WEP, WPA)
	- Connectivity testing for open access points :
		- DNS resolution of www.google.com
		- Google homepage retrieval
	- Easy scrolling
	- Timeouts for out of range APs

This app was inspired by wifi_lib_test v0.3a by Stephen Stair.
Thanks a lot Stephen for dswifi !
See his page at http://www.akkit.org/dswifi/.

There is not much to know, basic usage information is displayed
when launched.

Known bugs :
	- crashes sometimes when the number of APs is high (> 400)
	- when connecting to an AP then going back to scanning 
	  and trying to connect to another AP will not work
	  every time (dswifi bug ?)
	- timeouts handling is still probably a bit buggy

How to build :
1) make sure to use devkitARM 28 and dswifi > 0.3.12.
2) Setup env vars
3) Build by typing "make"


Please read the TODO file before mailing me.
Do NOT mail me to ask me how to crack WEP/WPA ...
Also, the DS is way too underpowered to be even close to useful
to crack WEP/WPA access point. If you want to do that, use a PC
and aircrack.
