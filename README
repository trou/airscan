AirScan is a basic wardriving utility for the Nintendo DS

There is not much to know, basic usage information is displayed
when launched.

Known bugs :
	- crashes sometimes when the number of APs is high (> 400)

How to build :
configure your build environment :
export DEVKITPRO=xxx/devkitpro21/
export DEVKITARM=xxx/devkitpro21/devkitARM/
export PAPATH=xxx/devkitpro21/PAlib/
export PATH=$PATH:$DEVKITARM/bin/
cd dswifi
make
cd ../arm7_mp3_dswifi_me
make
cd ..
make

Why do I include dswifi and arm7* ?
Because I patched dswifi a bit, I should try to push the patches upstream, but i'm a bit lazy

Please read the TODO file before mailing me.
Do NOT mail me to ask me how to crack WEP/WPA ...
