AirScan is a basic wardriving utility for the Nintendo DS

There is not much to know, basic usage information is displayed
when launched.

Known bugs :
	- crashes sometimes when the number of APs is high (> 400)
	- timeouts handling is bit buggy
	- when connecting to an AP then going back to scanning 
	  and trying to connect to another AP will not work
	  correctly

How to build :
Pach dswifi, rebuild, rebuild default.arm7, copy
now you can build airscan :
make
